GOALS:
Download music data for a single artist (of your choosing) and create the following endpoints for your API
    List all songs
    Find song by id
    Find songs by name
    Find songs by album id (collection id)
    Find songs by album name (collection name)
    Update song information by id
    Delete a song by id
    Add a new song
Add data for more than one artist then add the following endpoint
    Find song by artist id
    Find song by artist name
Stretch goal...Add music video data for multiple artists and add the following endpoints
    List all videos
    Find video by id
    Find video by name
    Find video by album id (collection id)
    Find songs by album name (collection name)
    Update video information by id
    Delete a video by id
    Add a new video
Stretch goal...Add more entities (for example, movie, podcast, audiobook, short film, etc.) and endpoints similar to the previous ones
Stretch goal...Add a simple front end (React) that consumes this API. One cool feature to implement is to allow the user to preview a song, video, or other media.
